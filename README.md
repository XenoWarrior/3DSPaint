# 3DSPaint
Simple and "hacky" paint tool for 3DS using C++, ctrulib and the HBL

# Build
Compile the 3DS .3dsx and .smdh file using the following command on Linux:

```Bash
  make
```

On Windows, you can configure Visual Studio to run a batch file (included) that will build the project (assuming a correctly setup system)
